<h4>Brewing 101 With CHEMEX</h4>
<p>How to Brew the best cup you have every time you have it </p>
<p>Like all good things,full flavor takes time — and your own special touch.</p>
<p>The CHEMEX® Coffeemaker delivers only the elements essential to rich coffee flavor, </p>
<p>so that your personal taste and approach shine through.

<p>Step 1: Get into the grind</p>
<p>Select your favorite whole bean coffee you want to enjoy and grind it to medium coarse ground.</p>

<br>

<p>Step 2: Filter up</p>
<p>Open a CHEMEX® Bonded Coffee Filter into a cone shape so that one side of the cone has</p>
<p>three layers, and place it into the top of the CHEMEX® brewer. The thick (three-layer) portion</p>
<p>should cover the pouring spout.</p>

<br>

<p>Step 3: The scoop</p>
<p>Put one rounded tablespoon of ground coffee for every 5 oz. cup into the filter cone. Feel free</p>
<p>to use more if you prefer it stronger; our CHEMEX® brewing process eliminates bitterness.</p>

<br>

<p>Step 4: Let it bloom</p>
<p>Once you have brought the appropriate amount of water to a boil, remove it from the heat and</p>
<p>allow it to stop boiling vigorously.</p>
<p>Pour a small amount of water over the coffee grounds to wet them, and wait for about 30</p>
<p>seconds for them to “bloom”, releasing the most desirable coffee elements from the grounds.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Step 5: First pour</p>
<p>After the grounds bloom, slowly pour the brewing water over the grounds while keeping the</p>
<p>water level well below the top of the CHEMEX® (quarter inch or more).</p>
<br>

<p>Step 6: Brew on</p>
<p>Slowly pour the remaining water over the grounds, using a circular or back-and-forth motion </p>
<p>as you pour to ensure an even soaking of the grounds.</p>

<br>

<p>Step 7: Toss the filter</p>
<p>Once the desired amount of coffee is brewed, lift the filter with spent grounds out of </p>
<p>the brewer and discard.</p>

<br>

<p>Stay warm</p>
<p>In order to keep your coffee warm you may place the CHEMEX® directly on either a</p>
<p>glass stove top or gas flame both at low heat. If you have an electric coil stove top,</p>
<p>you must utilize the CHEMEX® stainless steel wire grid (TKG) in between the</p>
<p>CHEMEX® and the coils to prevent breakage. Be sure that there is a small amount</p>
<p>of liquid in the carafe before placing it on a warm heating element.</p>
